## [Investigating the impact of the pandemic on music consumption]
- Used topic modelling and LDA on lyrics from songs before and after the pandemic.
- Compared logistic regression, boosted trees and random forest classifiers to distinguish between songs before and after the pandemic based on their audio features.
- Used Spotify API to retrieve audio features and Genius API to scrape lyrics.
- R libraries used: ggplot2, tidymodels, tm, topicmodels, caret, gbm, tree, randomForest.
- _Will upload this soon hopefully_
