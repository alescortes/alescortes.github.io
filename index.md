Hi!ðŸ‘‹ I am Alessandro. 

I am currently pursuing a Master's Degree in **Data Science** at the [**University of Trento**](https://www.unitn.it/en), Italy.

At the moment, I am a **Reseach Intern** at [**Fondazione Bruno Kessler**](https://www.fbk.eu/en/) (FBK), where I am working at the Complex Human Behaviour Lab (CHuB) under the supervision of Dr. Riccardo Gallotti. 

I am passionate about Machine Learning, NLP, Computational Social Science, Data Visualization, Cybersecurity and a whole lot of other topics.

When I'm not studying, working or writing my thesis you can probably find me hiking, running, making music or trying to learn German.
I'm also a big fan of maps and geography in general, and I love trying new cuisines.

[Here](src/prj/portfolio.md) you can take a look at some of the **projects** I've worked on during my Master's. I hope you'll find them interesting!
