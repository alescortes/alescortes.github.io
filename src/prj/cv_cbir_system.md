## [Content-Based Image Retrieval System](https://github.com/alescortes/foundations-information-retrieval)
- Repository for the group project of the Foundations of Information Retrieval course @ University of Twente, the Netherlands.
- The project is a comparison of different feature extractor methods for CBIR.
- Used the [MSLS](https://github.com/mapillary/mapillary_sls) dataset for Visual Place Recognition tasks.
- Employed both standard Computer Vision feature extractors (ORB, SIFT, SURF) and Deep Learning (VGG16), exploring different 
distance metrics.
- Performance was evaluated using Top Recall@K (R@K) and Mean Average Precision (mAP).
- Python libraries used: OpenCV, scikit-image, Tensorflow.
