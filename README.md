## M.Sc. in Data Science student @ UniTN

## [Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization of Renewable Energy Consumption in the EU](https://github.com/alescortes/european-energy-consumption)
- Analysis of an Eurostat dataset about renewable energies in the EU. 
- Used different types of visualizations (choropleth maps, bar charts, waffle charts, lineplots, ...) to gather insight from the data.
- Libraries used: pandas, geopandas, matplotlib, seaborn

## [Project 2: Big Data System to optimize the delivery of goods in the city of Milan](https://github.com/alescortes/food-delivery_bdt2022)
- Big data system to generate orders to a food delivery service and to match a set of delivery men to deliver such orders. 
- The system includes a MongoDB database to store the deliverymen, the pending orders, and the processed orders and a MQTT queue which acts as a buffer in the data ingestion phase.
- Distances are calculated using Openrouteservice API.
- The result of the program is a flask dashboard which displays a map and a series of analytics.
- Code is packaged using docker

## [Project 3: Content-Based Image Retrieval System]
- Work in progress

## [Project 4: Fake news classifier using Natural Language Processing]
- Work in progress

## [Project 5: Investigating the impact of the pandemic on music consumption]
- Used topic modelling and LDA on lyrics from songs before and after the pandemic
- Compared logistic regression, boosted trees and random forest classifiers to distinguish between songs before and after the pandemic based on their audio features
- Used Spotify API to retrieve audio features and Genius API to scrape lyrics
- In this project I used R and the following libraries: ggplot2, tidymodels, tm, topicmodels, caret, gbm, tree, randomForest
- Will upload this soon hopefully
