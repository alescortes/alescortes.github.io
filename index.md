Hi!ðŸ‘‹ I am Alessandro. 

I am a **Trainee in Data Science and Statistics** at the [**European Central Bank**](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/html/index.en.html) in Frankfurt am Main, Germany.

I hold a Master's Degree in **Data Science** from the [**University of Trento**](https://www.unitn.it/en), Italy.

Previously, I was a **Reseach Intern** at [**Fondazione Bruno Kessler**](https://www.fbk.eu/en/) (FBK), where I worked at the Complex Human Behaviour Lab (CHuB) under the supervision of Dr. Riccardo Gallotti.

I am passionate about Machine Learning, NLP, Computational Social Science, Data Visualization, Cybersecurity and a whole lot of other topics.

In my free time I enjoy hiking, running, making music and *trying* to learn German.
I'm also a big fan of maps and geography in general, and I love trying new food and cuisines.

[Here](src/prj/portfolio.md) you can take a look at some of the **projects** I've worked on during my Master's. I hope you'll find them interesting!

*P.S.: This website is still (or better, continuously) under construction.*
