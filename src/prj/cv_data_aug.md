## [Comparing state-of-the-art data augmentation methods on varying dataset settings]
- Group project for the Machine Learning II course @ University of Twente, the Netherlands.
- A study of how the performance of a CNN classifier changes when applying AugMix, CutMix, MixUp and GridMask on several downsampled versions of CIFAR-10.
- Checking if the methods increase robustness to common image corruptions using CIFAR-10-C as an OOD evaluation.
- Python libraries used: Tensorflow, Keras, scikit-learn.
- _Need to upload this as well..._
